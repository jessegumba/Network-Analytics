This was completed as a pre-module assignment for my MSBA program. 
* This code performs network analysis on a graph containing edges between products based on their sales ranks. 
* It also conducts data analysis on the graph to determine the out-degree and in-degree distribution of the nodes.

The code reads in four input files (not included in the code for security reasons):
* a text file containing space-separated edges representing a subset of the graph of top-ranked products
* a text file containing space-separated edges representing the largest connected component of the subset graph
* a text file containing space-separated edges representing the complete graph of products
* a text file containing space-separated pairs of IDs and product titles
